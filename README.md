# Pong Game

This repository contains the code for a simple Pong game implemented using the Turtle graphics library in Python. The game is a two-player version of the classic Pong arcade game.

## How to Play
- Player A controls the left paddle using the "W" and "S" keys to move up and down, respectively.
- Player B controls the right paddle using the Up and Down arrow keys.
- The objective is to hit the ball with your paddle and prevent it from reaching the edges of the screen.
- Each time the ball touches the opponent's side of the screen, the opposing player gains a point.
- The first player to reach 5 points wins the game.

## Features
- The game screen has a black background and is set to a size of 800x600 pixels.
- The paddles and the ball are simple square shapes displayed on the screen.
- The ball moves diagonally and bounces off the paddles and the screen edges.
- The score of each player is displayed at the top center of the screen using a Turtle graphics object.

## Dependencies
- This game uses the Turtle graphics library, which is a standard library in Python.
- The game also requires sound files (`bounce.wav`) for the bouncing sound effect.
